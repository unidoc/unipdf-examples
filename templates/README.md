# Templates

The creator package allows generating PDF files using templates. The templates
use an XML based markup language and they are parsed and translated into
creator components at runtime by the internal template processor.

The aim of templates is to make creating complex layouts a lot easier, faster,
and by writing less code. If no new data is required, template files can be
modified without the need to rebuild the application.
